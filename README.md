# Application Tools and Resources

## Android Apps
1. [Servers Ultimate](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.icecoldapps.serversultimate): Turn your Android phone into a server. 

## Win O/S Only Apps
1. [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php): Transfer files securely.

## Mac O/S Only Apps
1. [brew](https://brew.sh/): This is **the** package manager for Mac. It should have been included as part of Apple's O/S distribution.
1. [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/): This is another package manager that's pretty good.
1. [NTFS for Mac](https://www.paragon-software.com/us/home/ntfs-mac/): A non-free program for reading and writing NTFS filesystems by Microsoft. Very easy to use and the cost is very reasonable.
1. [Parallels](https://www.parallels.com): Virtualization software made specifically for Macs. It's fairly simple to use and comparable in functionality to VMWare Fusion. There's a home version and a pro version. Both are reasonably priced in my opinion. 
1. [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview): This is a really nice application for writing. It's mainly used for writing books, manuscripts, and plays, but I've been using it as a wiki because of the way I can categorize topics. It's not free, but it's not expensive, either. The cost is worth it. The only con I have is that it has a bit of a learning curve.

## Linux O/S Only Apps
1. [FVWM](https://www.fvwm.org/): A Linux window manager. Super configurable and flexible, but it's not for the faint of heart. Old school Linux users know what I'm talking about.
1. [Terminator](https://launchpad.net/terminator): My go-to terminal emulator. Part of many Linux distributions.
1. [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/): Windows emulator. Not perfect but has come a long way since inception in 1993.

## Any Desktop OS Apps
1. [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/): An integrated development environment for the Arduino IC boards. It uses C-like syntax to program the board. The Arduino IC boards are used in IoT and students and amateurs who want to learn how to do embedded coding.
2. [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/): A web browser from Google. It is very highly extensible with a huge plugin library.
3. [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/): An integrated development environment for developers. It can do Java, JavaEE, C/C++, Python, and a bunch of other programming langauges. It is highly extensible and well supported.
4. [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/): File transfer application for any O/S.
5. [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/): A very good, solid (usually) web browser that's been around for decades.
6. [Keycloak - IAM](https://www.keycloak.org/index.html): Open source identity and access management tool.
7. [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/): This is a very nice MS Office "clone". It can read and write most MS Office extensions. Though not perfect, it's my go-to office product in Linux and Mac.
8. [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/): This is an excellent email client that has a nice setup wizard that can handle types like pop3 and imap. I've been using Thunderbird for more than 10 years.
