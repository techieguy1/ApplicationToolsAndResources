# Application Tools and Resources

## Android Apps
1. [Servers Ultimate](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.icecoldapps.serversultimate): Turn your Android phone into a server. 

## Win O/S Only Apps
1. [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php): Transfer files securely.
1. [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview): This is the Windows port of Scrivener that was originally written for Mac. See info, below, under Max O/S.

## Mac O/S Only Apps
1. [brew](https://brew.sh/): This is **the** package manager for Mac. It should have been included as part of Apple's O/S distribution.
1. [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/): This is another package manager that's pretty good.
1. [NTFS for Mac](https://www.paragon-software.com/us/home/ntfs-mac/): A non-free program for reading and writing NTFS filesystems by Microsoft. Very easy to use and the cost is very reasonable.
1. [Parallels](https://www.parallels.com): Virtualization software made specifically for Macs. It's fairly simple to use and comparable in functionality to VMWare Fusion. There's a home version and a pro version. Both are reasonably priced in my opinion. 
1. [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview): This is a really nice application for writing. It's mainly used for writing books, manuscripts, and plays, but I've been using it as a wiki because of the way I can categorize topics. It's not free, but it's not expensive, either. The cost is worth it. It is *not* a word processor like MS Word. So, bear that in mind. The only con I have is that it has a bit of a learning curve.

## Linux O/S Only Apps
1. [FVWM](https://www.fvwm.org/): A Linux window manager. Super configurable and flexible, but it's not for the faint of heart. Old school Linux users know what I'm talking about.
1. [Terminator](https://launchpad.net/terminator): My go-to terminal emulator. Part of many Linux distributions.
1. [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/): Windows emulator. Not perfect but has come a long way since inception in 1993.
1. [xv](https://github.com/haegar/xv): This is a classic image viewer that has been around since about 1989. I've been using it since 1995 on various 'nix systems. It's free for personal use only. Some Linux systems have it as part of their distribution. Others, you need to use snap. Or, you can compile it yourself.

## Any Desktop O/S Apps
1. [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/): An integrated development environment for the Arduino IC boards. It uses C-like syntax to program the board. The Arduino IC boards are used in IoT and students and amateurs who want to learn how to do embedded coding.
1. [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/): This is a nice e-book reader that can handle many different formats such as pdf, mobi, epub, etc.
1. [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/): A web browser from Google. It is very highly extensible with a huge plugin library.
1. [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/): An integrated development environment for developers. It can do Java, JavaEE, C/C++, Python, and a bunch of other programming langauges. It is highly extensible and well supported.
1. [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/): File transfer application for any O/S.
1. [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/): A very good, solid (usually) web browser that's been around for decades.
1. [keepass](https://keepass.info/): This is a no-nonsense password safe. It's not elegant, you can't save anything to the cloud (unless you build your own), and it has ported code for the major operating systems and mobile devices. There are numerous plugins to make keepass even more robust to suit your needs. My favorite plugin is the one for Firefox which uses keepass to access user IDs and passwords for the websites I go to like my bank.
1. [Keycloak - IAM](https://www.keycloak.org/index.html): Open source identity and access management tool.
1. [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/): This is a very nice MS Office "clone". It can read and write most MS Office extensions. Though not perfect, it's my go-to office product in Linux and Mac.
1. [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/): Awesome notetaking app which is done in pure markdown language.
1. [Postman](https://www.postman.com/): From their site, "Postman is an API platform for building and using APIs. Postman simplifies each step of the API lifecycle and streamlines collaboration so you can create better APIsâ€”faster." **NOTE**: Postman is little flaky on some Linux distributions like Fedora.
1. [Pro Writing Aid](https://prowritingaid.com/): A very nice grammar and spelling aid that works directly with Scrivener. Windows and Mac users can download desktop apps. Linux users can use the web interface either pasting text into it or writing directly in it. Either, there will be a lot of copying and pasting. 
1. [synergy](https://symless.com/synergy): This is a software-based KVM that works in Windows, Linux, and MacOS. The software-based KVM uses one mouse and one keyboard across many computers of different operating systems. It will even work on a Raspberry Pi. You have to pay for this, but it's worth it. It's a one-time cost, and you get unlimited software updates. I've been using this software for years.
1. [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/): This is an excellent email client that has a nice setup wizard that can handle types like pop3 and imap. I've been using Thunderbird for more than 10 years.
1. [vim](https://www.vim.org/): Vi IMproved or vi. This is the grand daddy of all text editors that has caused many flame wars between it and emacs (another excellent text editor). Both vi and emacs have been around for decades although vi is older by about 9 years (vi came out in 1976). Vi is a very powerful text editor where navigation is by use of the keyboard using various key combinations. It's not for the faint of heart and is definitely not for beginners. It is highly customizable and configurable, and its configuration file is portable across different operating systems.
