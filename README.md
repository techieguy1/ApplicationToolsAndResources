# Application Tools and Resources

## Android Apps
1. [Servers Ultimate](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.icecoldapps.serversultimate): Turn your Android phone into a server. 

## Win O/S Only Apps
1. [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php): Transfer files securely.

## Mac O/S Only Apps
1. [brew](https://brew.sh/): This is **the** package manager for Mac. It should have been standard on all Macs.
1. [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/): This is another package manager that's pretty good.

## Linux O/S Only Apps
1. [FVWM](https://www.fvwm.org/): A Linux window manager. Super configurable and flexible, but it's not for the faint of heart. Old school Linux users know what I'm talking about.
1. [Terminator](https://launchpad.net/terminator): My go-to terminal emulator. Part of many Linux distributions.
1. [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/): Windows emulator. Not perfect but has come a long way since inception in 1993.

## Any Desktop OS Apps
1. [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/): File transfer application for any O/S.
1. [Keycloak - IAM](https://www.keycloak.org/index.html): Open source identity and access management tool.
1. [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/): This is a very nice MS Office "clone". It can read and write most MS Office extensions. Though not perfect, it's my go-to office product in Linux and Mac.
