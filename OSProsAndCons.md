# Pros and Cons of Operating Systems

Pros and cons of desktop/laptop operating systems. This is my opinion based on experience. Yours may be different.

**Pet peeve**: Many people think Ubuntu is an O/S. It is not. Linux is an O/S. Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Suse, RedHat, etc. are distributions of the Linux O/S.

## Mac O/S
#### Pros
* Meant for people who know little to nothing about computers.
* Easy to use.
* Eye candy.
* Has *the best* user experience.
* Has only one standard UI.
* Excellent for graphic artists.
* Very stable. I have yet to have my Mac O/S crash on me.
#### Cons
* Next to impossible to upgrade any hardware (laptop).
* Nearly everything is proprietary.
* O/S and hardware are highly coupled (laptop).
* Next to impossible to run in a virtual environment.
* Unless applications are from Gnu, many applications have costs.
* Not an O/S meant to be a server.
* Only runs on 1 type of processor (currently, runs on Intel, but that's going away in favor of the M1 chip).

## Windows O/S
#### Pros
* Meant for people who know little to nothing about computers.
* Fairly easy to use.
* Eye candy.
* Customizable.
* Huge repository of applications from programming to writing to system administration where many are free.
* Can be run in a virtual environment.
* Some versions allow your hardware to be made into a server.
* Can run on several different types of processors like Intel and AMD.
#### Cons
* Virus and malware prone.
* Stability issues.
* There are many versions of the O/S with some being very costly.
* Administration can be challenging for newbies.

## Linux O/S
#### Pros
* If no UI is running, Linux can be very stable.
* Very highly extensible and customizable UI and many window managers to choose from.
* Huge selection of Linux distributions to choose from.
* Very highly configurable from desktop to server.
* Can be run in a virtual environment.
* Nearly all Linux distributions are free.
* Used in many IoT devices.
* The majority of the servers in the world are running some Linux distribution variant (RedHat, Debian, etc.).
* Can be compiled to run on different processor types like Intel, AMD, ARM, etc.
#### Cons
* High learning curve, in general.
* Command line has huge learning curve.
* None of the available UI's are as polished as Apple or Windows.
* Applications ported from Windows or Mac to Linux sometimes have stability issues.
* Some window managers can and does have stability issues.
* Too many distributions to choose from which can be overwhelming to newbies.
* System administration can be challenging for newbies.
