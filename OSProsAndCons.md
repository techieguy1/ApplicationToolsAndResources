# Pros and Cons of Operating Systems

Pros and cons of desktop/laptop operating systems. This is my opinion based on experience. Yours may be different.

## Mac O/S
#### Pros
* Meant for people who know little to nothing about computers.
* Easy to use.
* Eye candy.
* Has *the best* user experience.
* Has only one standard UI.
* Excellent for graphic artists.
* Very stable. I have yet to have my Mac O/S crash on me.
#### Cons
* Next to impossible to upgrade any hardware (laptop).
* Nearly everything is proprietary.
* O/S and hardware are highly coupled (laptop).
* Next to impossible to run in a virtual environment.
* Unless applications are from Gnu, many applications have costs.
* Not an O/S meant to be a server.
* Only runs on 1 type of processor (currently, runs on Intel, but that's going away in favor of the M1 chip).

## Windows O/S
#### Pros
